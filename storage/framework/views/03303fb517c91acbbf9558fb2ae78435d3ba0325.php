              <!--<h3 class="color">University of Dar es Salaam Academic Staff Assembly</h3>-->
                <p>The University of Dar es Salaam Academic Staff Assembly (UDASA) was formed in 1980 as a standing committee of Convocation of the University of Dar es Salaam established under Section 42 of the University of Dar es Salaam Act, 1970 (Act No. 12 of 1970). The headquarters of the UDASA is at the main Campus of the University of Dar es Salaam. UDASA has its executive committee (EXCOM) that is made up of Chairperson, Deputy Chairperson, Secretary, Treasurer, Editor of the UDASA Newsletter, Deputy Secretary, One member of the Academic Staff from each Faculty/Institute Assembly elected by the General Meeting from the nominees of each College/School/Institute Assembly, not more than three members of Academic Staff nominated by the Executive Committee and endorsed by the Assemble and the Chairperson and Secretary of the College Assembly. The election for EXCOM members is done after every two years. </p>
                <p>The main objectives of UDASA include to stimulate and promote discussion on matters of academic interest; to promote academic functions of the UDSM and its Constituent Colleges; to support and promote the basic principles relating to academic freedom and social responsibility of the academics; to sponsor social functions for the purposes of enriching the intellectual and cultural development of the UDSM; to discuss any matters relating to the general welfare of the academic members of staff of the UDSM; to cooperate with other organs of the UDSM on matters of general interest to the University Community; and to deliberate on any other issue which may, from time to time, be referred to it by the Convocation. </p>
                <p>Every member of the Academic Staff of the UDSM becomes automatically a member of UDASA. However part-time, occasional and visiting members of the Academic Staff have a right to be members of UDASA except they shall be non-voting members of the UDASA. To attain its entire objective UDASA need to have in place a strategic plan that defines its strategy or direction and make decisions on allocation of its resources while at the same time act as a control mechanism in guiding implementation of the strategy.  </p>
